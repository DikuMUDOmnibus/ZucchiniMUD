I've put in a new version of the help command that lists all the help entries
matching your query - so you don't have to page through Color Spray every time
you want a list of custom color codes.
 
But there's a catch: you can't get at help entries whose keywords form the first
part of the keywords to another entry. For example, HELP ANSI gives you a choice
between 'COLOUR COLOR ANSI' and 'COLOUR2 COLOR2 ANSI2' with no way to actually
read the first colour entry.
 
I could fix the code, or I could just make sure all the help entries have
unique keywords. HELP COLOR has been changed to HELP COLOR1. If you find any
other necessary changes, please leave a note on the bug board.
