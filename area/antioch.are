#3480
The Center of the Lawn~
You stand in the center of a large lawn, almost park-like in size.  In
the very center is a fountain.  A concrete path surrounds it and branches
spoke off like a wheel from it outwards to the edges of the lawn. 
Comfortable looking sets of tables and chairs are placed with no discernable
pattern about the lawn, and some people casually sit or stroll about.

The Not-So-Center of the Lawn (Northwards)~
Following a path northwards a little bit (hey, how'd you know which way
north was?)  You find much of the same.  The lawn extends out from where you
are quite a ways.  White marble statues decorate it at places, and to the
south is the fountain.  People mill about trying to find something to do,
and occationally a rash adventurer comes by and kills them.

The Not-So-Center of the Lawn (Eastwards)~
As the path meanders towards what you think may be the east, you come
across a large statue in the middle of the path, which the path splits
around in a circle before joining up with itself on the other side.  The
statue shows a man cowering in fear of some object, which is presumably
larger than he is, as he seems to be looking up at it.  The artist did a
wonderful job of rendering the fear in his expression.  Sadly the statue is
also adorned with many pigeons and their...  presents.

The Not-So-Center of the Lawn (Westwards)~
The path here goes what must be west for a little ways and then splits
into 7 other paths, which meander about and around each other, before
joining back into one path about two hundred more feet west.  Each of the
paths is decorated with side-walk chalk.  From the looks of most of the
scrawlings small children are most likely responsible.  There are depictions
of people under the bright sun, hop scotch boards, and shuffle board
markings.  People mill about using the scrawlings for games or gazing at the
"breath-taking" artwork.

The Not-So-Center of the Lawn (Southwards)~
A large obelisk sits in the center of the path.  It's obsidian black and
seems to have small things carved on it.  At first guess you think they must
be letters, but they're not from any alphabet you recognize.  The obelisk
must be ancient, and indeed there are some people who are on their knees
before it, worshiping it.

Along the Southern Path~
To the east and west lie the lawn, vast and green.  People romp about
killing each other.  It's a grand place.  To the south you can see a large
barrier in the near distance, to the north lies the rest of the lawn.

The Southern Edge of the Lawn~
A large barrier of some kind blocks any further southward movement.  You
feel a sadness in your heart for not being able to go south anymore.  To the
west a large wall exists, spray-painted in crude letters are the words "I
RAN OUT OF SPACE".  Cryptic as they are, you can't quite figure out their
meaning.  To the east, the path through the lawn, the large southern barrier
everpresent.

Along the Eastern Path~
You walk along the eastern path and see people trying to find some way to
avoid the constant flow of bloodthirsty adventurers.  Signs have been posted
all over reading things like "Save the Mobs!"  "Please don't kill us!"  and
"The End is near!"

The Eastern Edge of the Lawn~
Three paths converge here.  One from the north, one from the south, and
one from the west.  Further east you see nothing but an endless void.  To
the north and south the path continues along the edge of the lawn.  Going
west will get you deeper into the lawn.

Along the Northern Path~
Shrubs line the path.  Large plants sculpted to look like animals stand
just off path.  Parts of the sidewalk are cracked and cratered here, as if
they had been his with very large, massive objects.  Now that you look,
parts of the lawn are also cratered, it almost looks like they've been hit
with very small meteors.

The Northern Edge of the Lawn~
As you reach the end of the path it just kind of drops off into
nothingness.  Steel rehabber juts out from under the sidewalk, it is twisted
and mangled.  It looks as if something just ripped off what used to be past
this point.  Looking out all you can see it the endless void of sky, and you
get a little dizzy as you boggle at it's immenseness.

Along the Western Path~
The further west you go, the fewer people there seem to be.  At this point
most of what you see is grass, and some shrubs.  Off the path there are two
knights duelling, over what, you cannot tell.  The path continues east and
west of here.

The Western Edge of the Lawn~
As you climb through the hole in the large concrete structure, you find
yourself in a lawn of some sort.  Three high concrete walls surround you to
the north, west and south.  The hole you climbed through is in the western
wall.  These walls extend up at least 3 stories and seem to loom over you. 
A small warning sign has been posted here, and the only exits are back into
the hole, or to the east.

The Northern Edge of the Lawn~
Along the northern side of the path is just a very, very steep drop off. 
So steep one might call it infinite, because it is.  To the south is the
lawn, pristine and perfect, except the the large craters left by
spellslinging adventurs and the numerours corpses.  The path continues east
and west.

The Southern Edge of the Lawn~
The large barrier continues to limit any ability to travel southwards,
the lawn itself extends northwards for some distance.  The path goes east
and west and east and west and east and west and...  East!

The Northeast Corner of the Lawn~
This is where two paths converge.  A large sign is posted at the corner,
which reads "Do not pass this point".  Looking beyond it you can see why:
There is nothing.  Not sky, not land, not sea, not space.  It would be bad
to go there...

cratered and littered with corpses.  The path leads north and south.

The Eastern Edge of the Lawn~
The path runs north and south.  The barriers extends from the south and
continues to lower, you can finally see over it.  Past the barrier is a
large void of nothingness.  It's rather unimpressive, except that it gives
you a sense of vertigo.

The Southeast Corner of the Lawn~
The large barrier takes a sharp turn northwards, and so does the path. 
Just after turning northwards the barrier starts to come lower to the
ground, although you can't quite see what's past it yet.
