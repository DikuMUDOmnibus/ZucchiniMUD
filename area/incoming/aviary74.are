{WAn enormous white bird sleeps on the water.{n
~
{w It is amazing that such a large bird can stay afloat.  The legendary
albatross rests on the calm waters.  For a moment, it rouses, and spreads
its wings to their full span.  After craning its neck backwards and to the
side, it drops its large, gliding beak into the water to snare a fish.  It
folds its wings back at its side and again returns to sleeping.  {n
