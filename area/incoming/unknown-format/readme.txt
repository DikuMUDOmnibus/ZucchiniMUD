This area was released by Rolindar for the Smaug codebase. I have converted this area to work with Merc 2.2

Please note:
The #AREADATA headings are not as standard. Please modify them for your specific Merc Mud, it will probably simply be a case of removing the fields that you have not installed if you are running a stock Merc.

The mobiles and objects do not have statistics on them, but they are all set with the correct flags. You should add your own damage and stats and so forth to place this area where it is useful in your mud. It currently has no level range.

The original Smaug area incoporated the full 10 directions. As stock Merc has only the original 6 directions (N, E, S, W, U and D) this area has been edited to only have 6 directions so it will boot with any standard Merc MUD. It is fully mappable and the directions will work with any ASCII mapper.

Everything else remains original as per the intent of the original creator. It uses extensive mobprogs which will have to be removed if you do not have this feature installed.

This area was converted by Athravan, Implementor of Dragon Swords MUD in December 2006.
She can be contacted at athravan@ntlworld.com, or in game at dragonswords.net, port 1234 - www.dragonswords.net
She is often happy to take requests for converting areas into Merc 2.2 as long as you are willing for them to be distributed back to the community.
