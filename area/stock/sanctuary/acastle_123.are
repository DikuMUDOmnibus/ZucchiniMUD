Opening in the Forest~
The forest here has been cleared out.  Pelts from various animals lay all
about the ground.  Sounds of barking make you jump as you turn to see a
large dog tied up just at the edge of the clearing.  You see a small hut at
the edge of the clearing just south of you.

As you enter the hut, you can see a iron furnace near the east wall with
a cot near it.  Book shelves line the west wall and are stuffed with various
bone cravings.
