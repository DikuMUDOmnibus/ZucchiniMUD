1 Emerald Forest~
The Emerald Forest is an enchanted wood thick with magic and power. Many
of its trees are older than the oldest cities of the known lands and 
though now tended to by a company of Woodkeepers, much of it still 
remains filled with the untamed and ineffable poetry of Nature.  
The Emerald Forest is home to a variety of magical faerie folk, like
the dryads, pixies, brownies and nymphs.  The twisted woods and marshes
to the west of the Forest, however, have been tainted by a trio of 
witches and their evil creatures.  The area is for level 15s to 50. 
Enough said, we hope you enjoy yourselves here :P
For more information on how to obtain a copy of Emerald Forest, read 
the stone tablet at the entrance.

Have Fun!

Dryad~
a dryad~
A dryad peers at you inquisitively from behind her tree.
~
With her slim fingers she holds her tree protectively as she looks at
you, her brown eyes full of innocence and curiosity.  As you approach 
her she looks startled and disappears into the tree, only to appear on 
the other side of it moments later to smile at you shyly.  The dryad
is just slightly taller than 5 feet and has the eternally beautiful
and youthful features of the faerie folk.

Nymph~
a nymph~
A nymph looks coyly at you, then winks mischeviously and dances away.
~
Her long hair is wet, as if just splashed with the waters of a crystal
brook or stream.  Her movements are full of grace and wild abandon as
she dances along the forest path.  You hear laughter like the sound of 
running water and you cannot be sure if it is her singing or a brook 
in the distance.  She calls out to you to join her in her dance.

A small pixie stands here laughing cheerfully.
~
A small, knee high little pixie looks really engrossed with the
activities of the Pixie-Brownie Bonanza. Not believed to exist by
most of the normal folk of Thera, he is clad in soft green leathers
and cloth and wears a small cap with a proud rooster feather sticking
out. Not looking at them directly, he seems to be eyeing one of the
brownies.

This brownie seems totally oblivious to your presence, and she seems
quite happy to continue chatting merrily to her friends. Slightly
shorter than pixies, the brownies have a reputation of wit and 
cheeriness with a touch of mischief. Like most brownies, she has
pretty elvin features, and is dressed totally in brown. She wears
no cap, her otherwise long hair tied in a pony-tail.

the Spriggan~
Iachimo the Dour Spriggan hides behind a tree grinning maliciously.
~
Iachimo is a spiteful prankster who often annoys the residents of the
Emerald Forest.  He sets fires at the roots of trees, poisons the 
streams and bites the pixies and brownies.  He doesn't have a good
bone in his spindly body and the forest would be well rid of him.
He unleashes a torrent of curses and invokes a hex on you in the name
of the witch-sister Hela.

    Singing a song:

    In the silent night
    I murmur'd my fears

    To seek for new Joy

Pixie~
a pixie~
A small pixie stands here laughing cheerfully.
~
A small, knee high little pixie looks really engrossed with the
activities of the Pixie-Brownie Bonanza. Not believed to exist by
most of the normal folk of Thera, he is clad in soft green leathers
and cloth and wears a small cap with a proud rooster feather sticking
out. Not looking at them directly, he seems to be eyeing one of the
brownies.

quite happy to continue chatting merrily to her friends. Slightly
shorter than pixies, the brownies have a reputation of wit and 
cheeriness with a touch of mischief. Like most brownies, she has
pretty elvin features, and is dressed totally in brown. She wears

  Or, if they have, where is my judgement fled,
  That censures falsely what they see aright?
  If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote,
  What means the world to say it is not so?
  if it be not, then love doth well denote
  Love's eye is not so true as all men's: no.
  How can it?  O! how can Love's eye be true,
  That is so vex'd with watching and with tears?
  No marvel then, though I mistake my view;
  The sun itself sees not till heaven clears.
  O cunning love! with tears thou keep'st me blind,
  Lest eyes well-seeing thy foul faults should find."

A haunted pine forest~
The snow begins to fall thickly as you enter a pine forest in the
mountains.  The burnt remains of two log cabins lie in a clearing 
about a dozen yards off the path.  There is a disconcerting silence
in these woods, an oppressive lifelessness that makes you want to
leave them immediately.  The trail stretches through these haunted 
woods up the side of the mountain and down through the fog to the 
foothills of the range.

The path has taken you to a junction over which hangs the twisted

little uncomfortable, you look south, where the forest seems to darken 
menacingly.  The east trail beckons you to the safety of the Emerald
Forest.

At the edge of a vale~
You walk up a hillside, following a path that runs along a clear stream.
It leads down into a grassy valley between some high mountains.  In the 
valley you see smoke rising lazily from the chimneys of several farms 
and cottages.  The road east runs down into a wooded dell.

A picturesque little village~
You walk into a small, picturesque hamlet that seems straight out of
the pages of a story-book.  The air is fresh and crisp with the light 
scent of flowers and passing yokels wave to you and call out friendly 
greetings, most of which are of the order of "Fair day to you, goodly
stranger" or "Whistle while you work, friend!" or "Won't you join us
for some dinner later, great hero?"  To the west, the road that runs 
through the village is lined by apple trees and quaintly-appointed 
farm houses.  To the north lies the village square, where preparations 
for some festivity seem to be in progress.  The road leads south out
of the village.

A small meadow on a green hillock~
You are on a small meadow on the hillock.  This seems to be where the 
folk of Clover have their picnics.  From the sound of manly crooning 
accompanied by girlish titters, you deduce it also where the local lasses
receive the attentions of their suitors.  Scattered trees and trimmed 
hedges provide the green with shadynooks and pivate arbors.  The 
hillock continues north, while the path west will take you back to the

A secluded corner of the meadow~
You are in a quiet corner of the meadow, well-shaded by two large cypress
trees.  Though empty now, it seems a likely spot for young couples to 
exchange professions of love, undisturbed by friends or irate parents. 
Having no time for such adolescent frivolities, you quickly scan the 
countryside and note that from this vantage point, you can look over the 
entire village of Clover.  You espy a dirt track which leads west from 
the village and then turns north to a ruined abbey.

cider.  You see a large farm to the north and a beaten dirt track to

empty husk of a dead nymph lies at your feet, and on either side of you,
the trees look twisted and tortured into unnatural shapes.  The depths 
of the forest sends up a hopeless cry to usher you into the woods that

parchment~

The parchment is yellowed and seems to have been savagely ripped from a
tome.  The edges are stained with blood and what legible text on it 
reads thus:

 "... I mouthed a prayer for my fallen brother Alandro as I raised his
  morning-star to smite the foul witch who had struck him down.  But I 
  had reckoned without her Sisters, and the twain now flew shrieking 
  towards me.  The first, diabolically transformed, pinioned me to the
  ground, while her corrupt breath drove the sight from my eyes and 
  caused boils to burst from my skin.  The other, whom I had seen to be 
  beautiful but terrible even as I was made blind wrested my weapon 
  from me and tore at my face.  I know not how I fled from their cursed 
  abode, but the relief I felt then at my escape was vainly felt, for 
  even now, I nightly suffer the torments of their evil blandishments.  
  In my sleep I see myself being chased at the edge of a black abyss by 
  the Devil's huntsmen and their hell-hounds slavering for my soul.  I 
  wake up drained, I feel both my faith and my sanity slipping from me.  

  We had been foolishly proud, thinking we could destroy those servants
  of evil alone.  Now we are undone, and the relic of our Holy Saint is
  lost forever."

on and on for a period of seven years.  You hear a titter of laughter

of Renhorden.  It seems to stretch endlessly into the sky, and you 
wonder why you did not see it towering above all the other trees in 
the forest.  You long to inch closer, but cannot seem to move beyond 
an invisible barrier that keeps you about a hundred yards away.  You

silver oak trees stands a likeness of Altariel, the Lady of the Woods.
At the base of the waterfall, a rock pool with crystal clear water has

leaves on the road.  All is quiet here.  To the north, dark Elder trees
loom out ominously.  The road continues south.

Everything is black here.  These bleak moorlands are where the witches 
plant the bodies of their victims, where the rotted corpses will rise by 
moonlight as souless pumpkin men.  The fetid marsh pools have been the

Pausing a moment from your travels through the Emerald forest,

while to the south the forest continues on with oak, pine and
rosewood. Peering intently toward the source of the sound, you

You stand on the western end of a wooden bridge in the Emerald Forest.
Its origin is a mystery, but the fine detail and craftsmanship it bears
would rival even the most cunning of woodsmiths.  The branches of the 
tall trees that grow on the banks of the stream cover the bridge in a 
soft cool embrace while a breeze flows in from the north.  Huge salmon
and rainbow trout weave their way amongst the rocks in the stream below.
To the west the forest stretches on, while the sounds of laughter and 
play drift in softly from the south.

You stand on the eastern end of a finely crafted wooden bridge. Its

is probably a form of pine or oak from the Emerald Forest itself.
Lacking the dull weathered tone and creaking of most wooden
bridges, it spans across a fairly wide river flowing in a north-south
direction. The height of the surrounding trees provide a pleasant
shade from the noon-day sun.

mentioned the existence of such a construction in the enchanted wood.
As far as you know, the forest has resisted gently but firmly all 
attempts at colonisation or lumbering, which makes it quite a 
curiosity.

with the Anti-Paladin heroine Elyse da'Ashlan standing triumphantly on
a crimson field, while behind her the white towers of Tourlane writhe 
in smoke and fire.

neat to be the result of Mother Nature's whim. In some areas the
shrubs and bushes appear to have gone out of their way (if that is
possible) to align themselves, and the soft wood grass while not having
the blunt heads of a kept garden seem to be growing neatly in line all
by themselves. Strong magic is at work here.

are numbered off. A number is called, and the respective brownie
or pixie has to run forward, grab the bag and return to the line

There is something rather peculiar about this part of the Emerald
Forest. A small tombstone sits in the middle of a small clearing.
Carved from a white substance, its shiny surface reflects what
little sunlight that manages to escape from the umbrella covering
of trees surrounding the grave. Freshly picked flowers lie at the
foot of the tombstone, while strange symbols are lovingly engraved
on it. The strange thing is there are no paths leading from or to the
area, which would puzzle even the most observant elf or ranger. Who
would pick flowers for a lone grave and leave no evidence of passing?

Multi-coloured flowers dance gaily in the wind while clinging to the feet
of the tall oak and pine trees flanking the forest road. Flying
squirrels leap from branch to branch, probably searching for a
delicious cashew or two.

dressed in a mixture of green and brown stand around here engaging in
friendly conversation. The actual Keepers' Meet hasn't started yet,

Thick green vines form an impossible barrier to the south. There is
no reason to doubt that these vines possess the same ability to
block even the most determined machete-armed lumber-dwarf then all
the others. What does seem a bit strange, however, are faint footsteps
leading up to the vines and abruptly stopping. Could they merely be
tracks from an age past, now lost to the world and found only in time
and memory?

The silent grove~
You've managed to wander into a small silent grove in the forest.
For some reason most of the forest noises seem to have disappeared, 
though you can feel the rustle of the leaves beneath your feet as 
you walk. The silence is strangely disquieting.  Small stones are 
arranged in an odd fashion on the ground, much the way seating 
chairs would be arranged should a speaker be standing in the middle
of the circle.  It's almost as though a little tribe of beavers 
just had a river-dam builders guild meeting and left for lunch.  
However, the crushed body of one particularly unfortunate beaver 
lying in a corner of the grove seems to indicate that it wasn't
lunch that the beavers left for...

a lazy looking lynx. To the north you can just make out a clearing

Standing here at the south-west end of the Brownie-Pixie Bonanza
Festival, your senses are quickly overloaded with sight, sound
and smell. Brownies clad in soft brown cloth with little feathered
hats mingle happily with their slightly smaller and greener cousins,
the forest pixies. An almost musical chitter-chatter fills the
air, while the aroma of freshly baked treats drift in from the
north. There seems to be a forest dweller's competition, what
with the many games the pixies and brownies seem to be playing. A tug
of war is currently in progress, with the heaving Brownies having
a slight lead over the grunting Pixies.

In a Myrtle Shade~
You are in a clearing ringed by mulberry bushes.  You hear racuous 
shouts of festivity coming from the north  where the Brownie-Pixie 
Bonanza is in full swing.  In the centre of the clearing is an old 
Myrtle tree, under the shade of which some revellers have taken to 
rest.  A lone thrush sighs from a branch of the tree.  To the west
a trail slopes gently down.

The Bonanza~
You are standing at the south-east end of the Brownie-Pixie Bonanza
Festival. A major element of the celebration involves the grand
feasting of the Great Pie of Friendship. A great huge pumpkin pie
the size of farmer's cart stands proudly on a stone table with a white
tablecloth amidst a bodyguard regiment of apples, peaches, raspberries
and cookies. The dozens of eager eaters seem a bit impatient,
apparently this year's Bonanza Chairman (or Grand Pooh-ba) hasn't
opened the ceremony yet.

South-easterly end of the forest~
You stand at the southern most end of the Emerald Forest. The path 
continues on north, while to the west appears to be a large clearing
with sounds of laughter and conversation drifting in with the breeze.
There is a sheer drop to the south, while moutains stretch on as far
as your eyes can see. The terrain belows seems mostly rock and stone
and has spare vegetation. You can just make out a small path heading
roughly to the east through a cluster of bushes and trees.

Within a garden~
You've managed to stumble into an oriental home. A small wooden hut
sits to the south of a garden lovingly nurtured with blooming yellow,
white and red flower blossoms. Two stone lions sit on wooden pillars 
guarding entrance to the garden, while two jade dragons guard the door 
to the hut proper. A small bucket pulled well stands next to a pen of 
chickens and ducks who cluck and quack away merrily. Carrots, cabbages 
and rice are grown in a medium sized plot of land to the north. There 
is a small rock pool to the east.

A peaceful rock pool~
You've entered a very peaceful part of the mystic's home. A crystal clear
pool sits here with large smooth pebbles neatly arranged all around it's
circumference. Peering into the pool, the unmoving mirror like surface of
the water reflect your image. There is no way of knowing exactly how deep
the pool is, but it must be very deep since you can't see the bottom. There
is a small wooden bench here beckoning you to sit and rest for a while,
and ponder things you've put aside, and think on matters you've forgotten.

Yun Fei Yang's humble abode~
You stand in the living room of a small wooden hut. A small partioned
kitchen is to the south of here. The spartan furniture, tidiness and
simple basic furniture hint at the occupier's character. There is a
beautiful painting of a young oriental women dressed in long flowing
silk on one of the walls. Parchments with foreign exotic wordings in
flowing black ink script sit on a desk. A small book catches your eye,
it's title being "Zhuge Liang's Chinese-Theran Dictionary". Some of
the scrolls here are written in a language you can understand.

The ruined monastery~
Tangled vines of ivy hang down from what remains of the arch-entranced 
of this small monastery.  It is ruined beyond repair and seems to have 
been abandoned many years ago.  There is a quiet and melancholic silence 
in the air.  You notice footprints in the dust that lead west into a 
leaf-strewn courtyard and continue into a small chapel.  You notice for
the first time that that area of the monastery seems to have been spared
the dereliction that the rest of the monastery has fallen into.

A well-kept chapel~
You stand within the only standing structure of the once proud monastery.
Evidently the chapel is looked after for the floors are swept, pews wiped
and the stained-glass windows in good working order. A modest pulpit 
made of mahogany with a carved pine cross attached to it faces a few rows
of wooden benches. Probably cared for by questing paladins or clerics 
on a pilgrimage, you wonder if any of the faithful might be nearby. There
is a hole in the west wall which appears to have been knocked in by a 
battering ram.  It has since been transformed into a pleasant archway 
that leads out of the chapel.  An iron grate to the north opens out into
a private courtyard.

Outside the wall of the monastery~
You stand in a small clearing outside the west wall of a small 
chapel within a monastery. Birdsong fills the air while butterflies
yellow and red flutter about happily. A tall large oak brings shade 
further west, but all movement to the north and south is prevented by a 
combination of trees and the old stone walls of the monastery. There
is a serenity and a sense of life and peace, hinting that it is often
used by others as a place of worship or contemplation.

The dead moors~
Everything is black here.  These bleak moorlands are where the witches 
plant the bodies of their victims, where the rotted corpses will rise by 
moonlight as soulless pumpkin men.  The fetid marsh pools have been the
graves of countless creatures, and the choking stench of death rises 
from them.

wind blows the fog away, and you see a small lake through the tall reeds
to the west.

The Witch Wood~
You are in the eerie domain of the Weird Sisters.  Ghost lights flicker
palely about your feet and cast a shadowed eye on a variety of rotting
plants and animals that cover the forest floor.  The twisted thorn trees
groan at your approach, and you are aware of a slow hissing that seems
to taunt you from the cover of darkness.  To the south a fog rolls out 
onto a dead marsh.

You are inside a neat and spotlessly clean cottage. The sanded wood plank
floors and timbered walls gleam in the soft light of several small oil lamps,
polished and waxed. Small ornaments of various shapes and sizes hang on the
walls and bright tapestries drape the rough wooden furniture and curtained
glass windows. Odd pieces of silver and crystal are sitting upon a long
trestled table in the middle of the room. Flowers from the forest, all cut
and arranged blossom from various vases and clay pots. The whole cottage
looks bright and cheerful even with nightfall. Obviously, someone with
good taste lives here!

Redbaron's Bedroom~
You walk into a much smaller room filled with sculptures instead of small
ornaments: over a hundred of them, lining the walls in holographic niches
as well as scattered around the floor on ornate pedestals. The variety, as
you have come to expect, is astonishing, ranging from human-style chunks of
simple stone and wood to others that were more like tethered living creatures
than works of art. Each is illuminated by a flaming blood candle, giving a
sharp contrast to the darkness around. You can barely make out a huge bed
that lies in the northeast corner of this gloomy room. Several other portals
seem to lead out of this room. You wonder where they may lead to...
