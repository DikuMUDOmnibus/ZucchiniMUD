banshee~
{DA dark figure sings: 
{W    "Tear drops on roses and whiskers on werewolves
     Dark bubbling cauldrons and warm bloody gloves
     Poor little people all tied up with strings
     These are a few of my favorite things.
 
     Cream colored vampires and crisp burning bodies
     Courtyards and graveyards and everyone rotting
     Wild demons flying with the moon on their wings
     These are a few of my favorite things.
 
     Girls in black dresses with red satin sashes
     Blood drops that stay on my tailed violet lashes
     Obsidian nights never leading to spring
     These are a few of my favorite things.
 
     When the vamp bites
     When the pierce stings
{W     When I'm feeling glad
     I simply remember my favorite things
     And then I can be so bad."
 
{DThe banshee pauses for a moment at your intrusion. She looks at you
expectantly, waiting for you to verbalize the lament you wish her to 
sing.{n

{CForeboding Gate{n~
{m The warm cloak of night envelops the suns and stars.  The earth
abruptly changes from a healthy green field to a dry lavender grass. 
Foreboding cliffs rise from the earth, surrounding the barren, forsaken
town.  They lift themselves to the velvet black sky, wounding it and leaving
only the scar of the scarlet moon to light the way.  An immense black gate
erupts from the ground, its iron fangs barring entrance to the torched city.
