A Dungeon of Doom~
You are in a plain stone room, with blank stone walls and a speckled
stone floor.  A dim light floats through the air, coming from no discernible
source and vanishing as it flows through small openings in the walls.  There
are large holes in the walls to the west and south, and a staircase leads
up.
