A Shady Footpath~
This is a shady footpath at the beginning of the dappled forest known as
Glen Dhoo.  Trees lay to the west of the path and a slope drops vertically
to a culvert below.  The path is well used but the trees appear to close in
on the path.  This is a shady footpath at the edge of the dappled forest
known as Glen Dhoo.  Trees lay to the west of the path, and the Eastern
Trade Road opens to the south.  The path is well used, but the trees loom
closely.

A Hidden Glade~
This is a hidden glade beyond the line of trees near the pool. The
trees still bear down on this little oasis, but there are more birds
flitting around in the branches of the trees and other creatures darting in
and out of the undergrowth.

tree and is filled with feathers, twigs and bits of moss. It is springy and

A Leafy Path~
This is a leafy path at the edge of a line of trees. The path meanders
to the west towards the crystal clear pool, and to the east it enters the
wooded area. The latter looks dark and foreboding but to the west the path
widens out, with the pool readily visible.

A Leafy Path~
This leafy path leads off to the east towards a wooded area and to the
north away from the crystal clear pool. The path overlooks the pool at this
juncture and there is a good view of the cascading waterfall not to mention
the mist and spray it causes when it hits the pool.

A Leafy Path~
This leafy path leads off to the south towards a wooded area and to the

A Leafy Path~
The leafy path appears to come to a dead end here. There is a solid
cliff wall to the west and trees to the north of the path. Spray from the
waterfall has drenched the ground here, making it rather muddy. The path
continues to the east towards a wooded area.
