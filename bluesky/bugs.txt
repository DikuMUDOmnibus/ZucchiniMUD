copyover while switched: copyover recover puts you back into NPC's body
 with no way to return except quitting & logging in again

act doesn't send things to NPCs - maybe it should check to see if
 there's an imm switched in?

no way to differentiate singular/plural mobs/objects, boo

hang on "quest request"?
