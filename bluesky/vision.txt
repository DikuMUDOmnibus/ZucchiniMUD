"Unlock" new areas - not using the level system, but by requiring skills, puzzle-solving, etc. which roughly correlate with levels, but require additional effort. Provides goals.

1. No classes. None. No limits on any character's potential. But there
should be *some* reward for specialization...

   - brain system was good, but too limited.

3. Antisocial mode: no interaction, just blowing off steam. No contact
between antisocial and other players. Not allowed for pkers.
